Squirt v0.0

A proof-of-concept example of adding custom blocks from a Bukkit plugin.

To install:
- add SquirtPlugin.jar to your Bukkit server's "plugins" folder
- install Minecraft Forge on your client, and SquirtClient.jar in its "mods" folder

To use:
- acquire the block, such as by executing the command: /give player 255
- place the block
- have fun

The block has ID #255, a texture similar to gravel, no drops, and instantly breaks.
